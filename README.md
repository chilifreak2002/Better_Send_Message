Send Message has been updated with a few cool features!
- If Message Failed | This action was once used in an old version of DBM but later removed after an update. This isn't a complete copy of the original but has been recreated by me.
- Persistent (Command Author Only) | This feature allows you to choose whether a persistent button or select menu option should only be persistent to the command author and no one else. This helps save time adding actions to check if the button user is command author.
- ~~Miliseconds~~ > Seconds | Using miliseconds as a time-limit always seemed like a bad idea so you can now add seconds! And SUPRISE if you make it 0 seconds, it'll make it an unlimited time-limit. This will allow the button and select menu to continue forever.
  Although it may seem similar to "persistent" it's still temporary as it is unlimited. Your interactions will end if the bot restarts.
